    <string name="about">This application serves for the purpose of mnemonic memorization. Every time you get a great idea but not so much time for writing it down, you can qucikly edit any of the items on the screen with a short description complete with a mnemonic hint. Later when you have more time, you can also go back and write a complete description of this item. Finally, once the information stored gets old and no longer useful, you can reset all items.</string>
